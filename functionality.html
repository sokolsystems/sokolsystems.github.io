                    <p><b>Sokol Systems’ Asset Record combines the functional richness of three common back office
                        systems: client positions and balances, cash records and balances, firm inventory system.
                        By bringing these three systems together we were able to eliminate unnecessary data integrity
                        controls which would normally be required to maintain data quality of back office.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>Double entry integrity controls were built into the product’s core. As a result, the quality
                        and integrity of the Asset Record is never compromised. At the same time, the behaviour of
                        the double entry integrity is fully customizable through the implementation of custom journal
                        postings modules.</p>
                    <p>Flexible journalling rules - At Sokol Systems, we focused on implementing  the necessary ability
                        to expand product coverage of the engine with minimal effort (from a couple of hours to a couple
                        of days). As a result, the engine offers complete freedom to define how the incoming transactions
                        of different types and classifications should be processed. The included with the product equity
                        buy/sell and settlement journalling components provide a fully functional reference implementation.
                        High performance open source rules engine is utilized to simplify the journalling component
                        selection for a specific legal entity, instrument type and transaction type.</p>
					<p>Asset Record Engine explicitly defines and reliably maintains the following standard position buckets:
                        <ul>
                            <li>start of day traded quantities</li>
                            <li>current traded quantities</li>
                            <li>value date start of day quantities</li>
                            <li>current value date quantities</li>
                            <li>start of day settled quantities</li>
                            <li>current settled quantities</li>
                            <li>future (T + X) dated settlement projections.</li>
                        </ul>
                        These quantities are computed wholistically, complete referential data integrity across all
                        these quantities is maintained by the processing engine. The position changes are recorded
                        into the position store as a single operation preventing any inconsistency between these quantities.</p>	
                </div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Standard settlement data points are automatically computed by The Asset  Record Engine. It
                        performs the necessary calculations related to settlement projections and keeps track of the
                        future settlement quantities based on the settlement dates provided on the incoming transactions
                        and the market calendar details. Settlement position quantities are automatically calculated as
                        "contractually settled" on the settlement date. Settlement postings are computed by a special
                        component that is specifically designed to handle various settlement events.<br />
                        Both Depot and Nostro movements are supported and implemented as standard features of the engine.
                        The only necessary customization to support cash Nostro and stock Depot movements is in the
                        implementation of the settlement journalling component (reference implementation is provided
                        and can be used without any changes).</p>
                    <p>Sokol Systems’ Asset Record Engine has a sophisticated mechanism to instantaneously compute
                        position quantities with (as-of) and without (as-at) impact by backdated trades (adjustments)
                        in real time with no performance degradation.</p>
                    <p>Asset Record Engine provides an ultra high performance snapshot capability. A full snapshot of
                        the live position store can be taken with a single command. The system doesn’t even need to be
                        shut down. The integrity of the datastore is ensured by the engine. The position store snapshot
                        contains all the current positions including market business day information for every market
                        in the system.</p>
                    <p>The Asset Record Engine is a multi-market system capable of real-time processing of business
                        events from all markets across the world. It employs open source calendar libraries to reliably
                        compute settlement projections and perform various business date calculations. Since, every
                        financial institution has its own business calendar maintained in some reference data catalogs,
                        Asset Record Engine provides flexibility to define and configure market holidays. No separate
                        software deployment is required, the new version of the country or market specific configuration
                        files is picked up by the running engine automatically.</p>
                    <p>Sokol Systems’ Asset Record is designed from the ground as a single business solution to handle
                        all Client, Broker and Firm stock and cash positions. The consistency of the data between
                        Client, Firm, Broker, Stock and Cash is built into the journal posting logic and can be easily
                        augmented by providing multiple pluggable implementations of the journalling components.</p>
                    <p>The Asset Record Engine implements a configurable multi-market end-of-day processing.
                        End-of-day process can be initiated on demand by sending a command to the engine or configured
                        to be performed automatically at a specific time. When the system receives an end-of-day
                        request, it switches to the next business day instantaneously, but also, takes a full
                        end-of-day snapshot of the complete position store.<br />
                        Once end-of-day event for a specific market is processed, any incoming transactions for that
                        market are processed with a new business date. In case a trade was delayed and the end-of-day
                        event happened before all the trades for the day were processed, these trades will be handled
                        as back-dated adjustments (see As-Of and As-At processing).</p>
